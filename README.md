## Introduction

**I'm Mazzie!** I'm an aspiring programmer.

I've been interested in programming and computers for more than a decade and have good fundamental knowledge, but I lack experience with larger projects. 
I hope that in publishing my projects to GitHub and helping others with their projects, I will learn valuable skills to help me get a step in the door for my career.
